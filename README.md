# Meme Generator App

In this project, we can create our own meme and save in jpg format as well.

I used React.js, React-Bootstrap.

# memeURL  
'https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes'


# Library Used

1) react-router-dom -> for routing the link.
2) react-component-export-image -> for save the image in which format we want.
3) react-draggable -> to drag the text we write.
